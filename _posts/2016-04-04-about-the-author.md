# UX process

UX process developed to cater for geographically-distributed product teams operating with different approaches to agile. Many teams had not had UX support before and it was important to us to define and execute meaningful processes that would validate direction and confirm assumptions before reaching development. This was an iterative approach and this process has been successfully adopted by multiple teams.
