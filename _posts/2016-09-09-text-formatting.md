# Design System

The evolution of the our Design System has taken us on an interesting journey. While I was not directly involved with the creation of components (this was down to our supremely talented Senior UI Designer) I was heavily involved in the IA, content, review and test. 
The value of this resource has already been proven - it's an essential tool for onboarding, UX design and developer self-service. 
The next step is to incorporate our dev component library.
