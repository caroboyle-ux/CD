# Personas
This was a painful but worthwhile project as part of a wider UX initiative to improve the perception of UX and raise the profile of the UX team. Gathering persona information from multiple product teams, interviewing users, ensuring inclusivity, and ultimately communicating them was a long process. 
Foldables of personas representing product teams in multiple locations are now present in every meeting room in the company. Posters appear in every office. We continue to push persona enhancement and the next goal is to explore the use of data personality profiles.
